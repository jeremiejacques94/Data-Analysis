SQL practice project based on the Car Sales report dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/missionjee/car-sales-report/discussion

The questions asked throughout the project were generated by ChatGPT to give me basic structure and guidance in order to make the project interesting. 

As the analysis went on, I started to learn that the had been pretty poorly generated (Income is extremely high, data distribution is almost always the same accross different variable, etc.)

I was still able to perform the analysis and practice my SQL skills, but not that many insights were generated from the analysis.

I will try to use better datasets in the future for more realistic analyses
